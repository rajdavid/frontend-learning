    JavaScript primarily works in the browser, and it's the programming language that powers the dynamic behavior on most websites. Understanding how JavaScript works help in leveraging its capabilities in web development. Here's an overview:

    JavaScript Engine: Browsers have JavaScript engines that parse and execute JavaScript code. V8 (Chrome), SpiderMonkey (Firefox), and Chakra (Edge) are examples of JavaScript engines.

    Interpretation vs. Compilation: JavaScript was traditionally an interpreted language, meaning code is executed line by line. However, modern JavaScript engines use Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, converting JavaScript to optimized machine code just before execution for improved performance.

How interpretor works :
    Interpretation is a method of executing code where an interpreter reads and executes the source code line by line, without prior conversion to machine code.

The JavaScript source code is loaded into the interpreter.
The interpreter reads the code line by line, starting from the top.
As the interpreter encounters each line, it parses and executes that line immediately.
The interpreter maintains the program state, such as variable values and function definitions, in memory.

How compiler works :

Compilation:
Compilation, on the other hand, is the process of translating source code into machine code before execution. The compiler takes the entire source code, analyzes it, and generates an executable file containing machine code specific to the target platform. Here's how the compilation process typically works:

The JavaScript source code is loaded into the compiler.
The compiler analyzes the code, checks for syntax errors, and performs various optimizations.
The compiler generates an executable file containing machine code specific to the target platform.
The generated machine code can be directly executed by the computer's processor.

Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation in JavaScript:

JIT compilation combines the benefits of interpretation and compilation. Here's how it works:

The JavaScript code is initially interpreted by the JavaScript engine.
As the code executes, the JIT compiler identifies frequently executed code paths or "hot" code.
The JIT compiler compiles the hot code into optimized machine code on the fly.
The optimized machine code is then used for subsequent executions of the same code path, resulting in faster execution.
The JIT compiler continues to monitor the execution and can further optimize the machine code based on runtime information.
JIT compilation allows JavaScript engines to start executing code quickly through interpretation and then optimize performance by compiling hot code paths to machine code. This approach provides a balance between fast startup times and optimized execution speed.
